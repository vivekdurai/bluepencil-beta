    We may use Personal Information and other information received and collected from you to provide the Services you have requested, including for the purpose of sending you updates or to contact you upon your request and when otherwise necessary. We may also use Personal Information for auditing, research and analysis, and to operate and improve our Services. In certain circumstances, we may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties. In certain limited instances, Personal Information that you provide towards creation of a publicly visible profile on our Website may be indexed by search engines (such as www.google.com and www.bing.com) and may appear in search results on such search engines. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your Personal Information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

    6. Confidentiality and Security
    We will keep confidential and protect your Personal Information except where disclosure is required or permitted by law.
    
    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and, once we receive it, for storage and disposal.

All information we gather is securely stored within databases controlled by us. The databases are stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

We do not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on our behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against our policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent.
    
    If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we may transfer that Personal Information from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Your Personal Information may be collected and stored on servers located in the territory of India and such other countries as we may disclose from time to time.

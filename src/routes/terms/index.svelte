<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">We may modify this Agreement from time to time and such modification will be effective upon posting on the Services.

<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">Please note that Section 9 contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver. By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you agree (a) to resolve all disputes with us through binding individual arbitration, which means that you waive any right to have those disputes decided by a judge or jury, and (b) that you waive your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or representative actions. </div>

<div class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">1. CONTENT</div>

You may not modify, remove, delete, augment, add to, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works from, or in any way exploit any Proprietary Materials, or any other protectable aspects of the Services, in whole or in part, unless specifically stated otherwise. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and any other relevant policies related to the Services, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited license, subject to the limitations herein, to access and use the Services and Proprietary Materials for your own non-commercial entertainment purposes consistent with the intended purpose of the Services. You agree not to use the Services for any other purpose.
You may be able to post, upload, or submit content to be made available through the Services (“Your Content”).

</div>
<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE PURCHASE OF ANY PRODUCT THEREFROM, EVEN IF WE OR SUCH PROVIDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID US IN THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY (180) DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM, AND IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANY AMOUNTS DURING THAT TIME PERIOD, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO CEASE USING THE SERVICES AND TERMINATE YOUR ACCOUNT.
</div>
<div class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">7. LEGALITY</div>

<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">You are subject to all laws of the state(s) and countries in which you reside and from which you access the Services and are solely responsible for obeying those laws. You agree we cannot be held liable if laws applicable to you restrict or prohibit your participation. We make no representations or warranties, implicit or explicit, as to your legal right to participate in any Services, contests, sweepstakes or tournaments offered through the Services nor will any person affiliated, or claiming affiliation with the Services have authority to make any such representations or warranties.
</div>
<div class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">8. APPLICABLE LAW; JURISDICTION</div>

<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">The Services are created and controlled by us in the State of New York. As such, the laws of the State of New York will govern this Agreement, without giving effect to any provisions of New York law that direct the choice of another state’s laws.
</div>
<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">Subject to the Binding Arbitration section below, you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in New York, New York for any litigation arising out of or relating to use of or purchase made through the Services (and agree not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts).
</div>
<div class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">9. BINDING ARBITRATION</div>

<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including any threshold questions of arbitrability, will be determined by binding arbitration. The arbitration proceedings will be held and conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Agreement. Such arbitration will occur in New York, New York, and be initiated by any party in accordance with the JAMS Rules. The demand for arbitration will be made by any party hereto within a reasonable time after the claim, dispute or other matter in question has arisen, and in any event will not be made after the date when institution of legal proceeding, based on such claim, dispute or other matter in question, would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Discovery issues will be decided by the arbitrator. Post-hearing briefs will be permitted. The arbitrator will render a decision within twenty (20) days after the conclusion of the hearing(s). In reaching a decision, the arbitrator will have no authority to change, extend, modify or suspend any of the terms of this Agreement, or to grant an award or remedy any greater than that which would be available from a court under the statutory or common law theory asserted. The arbitrator will issue a written opinion that includes the factual and legal basis for any decision and award. The arbitrator will apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of New York or federal law, or any of them, as applicable to the claim(s) asserted. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties may seek, from a court of competent jurisdiction, provisional remedies or injunctive relief in support of their respective rights and remedies hereunder without waiving any right to arbitration. However, the merits of any action that involves such provisional remedies or injunctive relief, including, without limitation, the terms of any permanent injunction, will be determined by arbitration under this paragraph. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will allocate all costs and expenses of the arbitration (including legal and accounting fees and expenses of the respective parties) to the parties in the proportions that reflect their relative success on the merits (including the successful assertion of any defenses).
</div>
<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">You agree to pursue any arbitration in an individual capacity and not as class representative or class member in any purported class action proceeding.
</div>
<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES, THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THEY ARE IRREVOCABLY WAIVING ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIVITIES CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
</div>
<div class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">10. INDEMNITY</div>

<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">You agree to indemnify and hold OneBigPicture, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our respective officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this Agreement and/or any of your representations and warranties set forth herein.
</div>
<div class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">11. SEVERABILITY</div>

<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be severable. If for any reason any provision of this Agreement will be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.</div>

<div class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">12. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS</div>

<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">When you use the Services or send emails to us, you are communicating with us electronically.

<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">This Agreement is deemed accepted upon any use of any of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</div>

<div class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">14. SUPPORT</div>

<div class="text-lg font-regular text-gray-800 mb-2">Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, we will attempt to help you with any queries or problems that you may have with the Services or any of your purchases through the Services.
